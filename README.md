# 8-Ball-Pool-trainer (FIREFOX)
This is an _HTML_ overlay for _FIREFOX_ that can help you train your aim on _Miniclip's 8 Ball Pool_ game.  
  
Only tested with a _1280x1024_ monitor. The _pocket coordinates_ are in _pixels_, thus if it is used with a _different resolution_ monitor the easiest way would be to _change the resolution_ from inside the OS to 1280x1024 or to the _change the coordinates_ from inside the code _(the pozPocket array)_.
