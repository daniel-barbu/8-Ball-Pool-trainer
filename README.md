# 8-Ball-Pool-trainer
This is a HTML overlay that can help you train your aim on Miniclip's 8 Ball Pool game.  
  
Only tested on _Firefox 74.0 (64-bit)_ with a _1280x1024_ monitor. The pocket coordinates are in pixels, thus if it is used with a different resolution monitor the easiest way would be to **change the resolution** from inside the OS to 1280x1024 **or** to the **change the coordinates** from inside the code (the pozPocket array).
  
## Installation
The overlay is made for the webpage on the first line of the **code.js** file, make sure to open that link.  
After that, open the raw code and copy-paste it to the console of the previously opened webpage.
  
## Controls
Left, Right, Up, Down (Arrow Keys): move the red circle.  
0 (Numpad): commute between 2px and 10px movement.
