# 8-Ball-Pool-trainer
This is a HTML overlay that can help you train your aim on Miniclip's 8 Ball Pool game.  
  
Only tested on _Firefox 74.0 (64-bit)_ with a _1280x1024_ monitor. The pocket coordinates are in pixels, thus if it is used with a different resolution monitor the easiest way would be to **change the resolution** from inside the OS to 1280x1024 **or** to the **change the coordinates** from inside the code (the pozPocket array).
  
## Installation
The overlay is made for the 'focus' webpage, make sure to be on [that webpage](https://www.miniclip.com/games/8-ball-pool-multiplayer/en/focus/).
After that, open the raw code and copy-paste it to the console of the previously opened webpage. This has to be done everytime.
  
## Controls (if they stop working click above or below the game `<canvas>`)
Left, Right, Up, Down (Arrow Keys): move the red circle.  
0 (Numpad): commute between 2px and 10px movement.
