# 8-Ball-Pool-trainer (FIREFOX)
This is an _HTML_ overlay for _FIREFOX_ that can help you train your aim on _Miniclip's 8 Ball Pool_ game.  
  
Only tested with a _1280x1024_ monitor. The _pocket coordinates_ are in _pixels_, thus if it is used with a _different resolution_ monitor the easiest way would be to **change the resolution** from inside the OS to 1280x1024 **or** to the **change the coordinates** from inside the code _(the pozPocket array)_.
  
## Installation
The overlay is made for the webpage on the _first line_ of the **code.js** file, make sure to open that link.  
After that, open the _raw_ code and copy-paste it to the _console_ of the previously opened _FIREFOX_ webpage.
  
## Controls
Left, Right, Up, Down (Arrow Keys): move the center of the red circle.  
0 (Numpad): commute between 2px and 10px movement.
