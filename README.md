# miniclip-8BallPool-trainer<sub>(chrome<s>+firefox</s>)</sub>
miniclip-8BallPool-trainer is a HTML overlay that can help you train your aim on Miniclip's 8 Ball Pool browser game.  
Also has the zoom capabilities and performance boost of [miniclip-8BallPool-maximizer](https://github.com/daniel-barbu/miniclip-8BallPool-maximizer).

### How to use
1. The overlay is made for the ['focus' webpage](https://www.miniclip.com/games/8-ball-pool-multiplayer/en/focus/) of the game, so make sure to be on that webpage and to disable your adblocker.
2. After the game loads, open [`code.js`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daniel-barbu/8-Ball-Pool-trainer/master/code.js) and copy-paste the code to the console while the `<body>` tag is selected.

### Known Issues
1. Your screen resolution has to be set to 1280x1024.
2. You have to copy-paste the code to the console eveytime you want to play.  
   It might be possible to use an extension/add-on like [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/)/[Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) to automate this process.
